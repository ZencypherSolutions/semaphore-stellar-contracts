# Semaphore-stellar
This project aims to integrate Semaphore's privacy-focused protocol with the Stellar network, enabling private and anonymous voting or signaling in Stellar-based applications. Since Stellar is not EVM-compatible, this tool bridges the gap to make Semaphore functionalities accessible in Stellar's ecosystem.

## Project Structure
- Documentation: Key technical documents and guides are located in the root directory and the [`research`](https://github.com/ZencypherSolutions/semaphore-stellar-docs/tree/main/research) folder.
- Contracts: Smart contracts designed for Semaphore-Stellar interaction are within the [contracts](./semaphore-contracts/contracts) folder.

## About Semaphore
Semaphore is a zero-knowledge protocol designed to provide privacy for applications. It allows users to prove membership in a group without revealing their identity, making it ideal for anonymous voting or signaling.
